# 🎯 Action Plan - Fix Microphone & ElevenLabs Issues

## ✅ What I Just Fixed

### 1. **Security Issue - FIXED** ✅
- **Problem:** API key was in `client/.env.production` (exposed to users)
- **Fix:** Removed API key from frontend
- **Result:** API keys now only on backend (secure)

### 2. **iOS AudioContext Issue - IMPROVED** ✅
- **Problem:** AudioContext suspended on iOS Safari
- **Fix:** Enhanced retry logic with double-attempt resume
- **Result:** Better iOS Safari compatibility

### 3. **Documentation - ADDED** ✅
- Created `IOS_MICROPHONE_FIX.md` with comprehensive troubleshooting
- Covers iOS-specific issues, HTTPS requirements, and ElevenLabs setup

## 🚀 What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Wait for Render Deployment (5 minutes)
Your code is pushed to GitHub. Render will auto-deploy:
- ✅ Frontend: https://promptlingo-frontend.onrender.com
- ✅ Backend: https://promptlingo-backend.onrender.com

**Check deployment status:**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Watch the deploy logs
3. Wait for "Deploy live" message

### Step 2: Test on Desktop First
**Open:** https://promptlingo-frontend.onrender.com

1. **Click record button**
2. **Grant microphone permission**
3. **Speak into microphone**
4. **Check diagnostics:**
   - Audio Level should show > 0%
   - MediaRecorder State: "recording"
   - Stream Active: Yes

### Step 3: Test on iOS Safari
**Important iOS Notes:**
- You may need to tap record button TWICE
- First tap activates AudioContext
- Second tap starts recording
- This is normal iOS behavior

**Test Steps:**
1. Open app on iPhone/iPad Safari
2. Tap record button
3. Grant microphone permission
4. **If you see "User interaction required" error:**
   - Tap record button AGAIN
   - This is expected on iOS
5. Speak and check audio levels

### Step 4: Test ElevenLabs Audio
1. Record a voice message
2. Wait for transcription
3. Translate to another language
4. **Click play button**
5. Should hear ElevenLabs voice

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Audio Level Still 0%

**Try These Steps:**
```
1. Close all other apps using microphone
2. Restart Safari/browser
3. Check microphone isn't muted in system settings
4. On iOS: Disable Low Power Mode
5. Try tapping record button twice
```

### Issue: ElevenLabs Voice Doesn't Play

**Check Backend Environment Variables:**
1. Go to: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select: `promptlingo-backend`
3. Go to: Environment tab
4. Verify these are set:
   - `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` = your_key_here
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY` = your_key_here
   - `NODE_ENV` = production
   - `PORT` = 10000

**Check Backend Logs:**
1. Render Dashboard → promptlingo-backend → Logs
2. Look for:
   ```
   🔑 API Keys Check:
      - ElevenLabs: ✓ Set
   ```
3. If you see `✗ Missing`, add the key in Environment tab

### Issue: "Permission Denied" on iOS

**This is normal iOS behavior:**
- iOS asks for permission every session
- Permission doesn't persist across sessions
- User must grant permission each time

**Solution:**
- Grant permission when prompted
- Keep app in foreground while recording

## 📊 Expected Results

### ✅ Working Microphone:
```
✓ Microphone Permission: granted
✓ MediaRecorder State: recording
✓ Audio Tracks: 1
✓ Audio Level: 10-80% (when speaking)
✓ Stream Active: Yes
✓ Chunks Collected: > 0
✓ Data Recorded: > 0 KB
```

### ✅ Working ElevenLabs:
```
✓ Backend health shows: "elevenlabs": "working"
✓ Audio plays when clicking play button
✓ Clear voice quality
✓ No CORS errors in console
```

---

## 🎯 Key Points

### Microphone on iOS:
1. **HTTPS Required:** ✅ Render provides this automatically
2. **User Interaction:** May need to tap record button twice
3. **Permission Prompt:** Appears every session (normal)
4. **Low Power Mode:** Disable for best results
5. **Background Tabs:** Keep app in foreground

### ElevenLabs API:
1. **API Key Location:** Backend only (Render environment variables)
2. **Never in Frontend:** Security risk if exposed
3. **Backend Proxy:** Frontend → Backend → ElevenLabs
4. **CORS Configured:** Backend allows frontend domain
5. **CSP Updated:** Frontend allows ElevenLabs API domain
