Sofia Rodriguez: Diary Entries

(The Night Before the Essay is Due) 
Date: October th Time: : AM 
The fluorescent light of the kitchen is a cruel, sterile sun. It burns into my tired eyes, but I cannot look away from the screen. It is a battlefield, and I am losing. My nursing essay on 'Aseptic Technique' is due in seven hours, and the words I type are not my own. They are clumsy, broken things, like pieces of glass that cannot form a window. 
I know the material. Dios mío, I perform these techniques every night at the facility. My hands are sure, my movements precise. I can save a life with my hands, but I cannot write a simple, professional paragraph. The knowledge is trapped inside me, a vibrant bird in a cage made of bad grammar and missing articles. 
The shame is a cold, heavy stone in my stomach. I look at the sentence I just wrote—a sentence that sounds like a child dictated it—and I feel my face burn. I am a grown woman, a mother, a professional, but this language reduces me to an idiot. I can hear the professor’s internal voice, the one that doesn't say "good effort," but thinks, She's not smart enough for this program. 
I hate Google Translate. It is a liar. It takes my beautiful, nuanced Spanish—my thoughts of sacrifice and precision—and spits out a robotic, soulless phrase. It makes me sound like a machine, not a human with a brain full of knowledge. I have to spend an hour trying to polish its rough edges, and still, it feels wrong. It’s a time thief, stealing the precious minutes I could be sleeping, the minutes that belong to my children. 
The anxiety is a thin, sharp wire wrapped around my chest, tightening with every misspelled word. What if I fail this class? What if I never get my RN? My husband works so hard. My children look at me with such trust. The thought of being stuck forever in the CNA grind, my body aching, my future capped by this invisible, hateful wall of English—it keeps me awake. It is the monster under the bed, and its name is miscommunication. I am so angry at this system, at this barrier, at myself for not being stronger. I need a voice that matches my competence. I need it now. 
Entry : During Their First Use of Product 
(Testing the App with a Complex Work Email) 
Date: October th Time: : PM
I am hiding in the breakroom during my fifteen-minute break. I have to send an email to the charge nurse, requesting a change in a patient’s documentation protocol—a delicate, formal request that needs to be perfect. If I mess this up, I look unprofessional and risk a confrontation. 
My heart is pounding against my ribs, a frantic little drum. I open the new app—the one my friend Maria told me about. I type my request in rapid, stressed Spanish, pouring out the technical details and the formal tone I want to convey. My fingers fly across the screen, a torrent of my true, intelligent self. 
Then I press the button. 
The screen doesn't just show a word-for-word swap. It shows a transformation. I read the English output. I read it again. 
Resentment flares up first, sharp and hot. This is what I meant! Why couldn't I write this? It’s clean, respectful, and uses the exact medical terminology I was struggling to recall. It sounds like a native speaker, a professional, a peer. The app has given me the voice I already own in my head. I feel a sudden, violent urge to cry, a mix of relief and pure, bitter anger that this tool didn't exist a year ago. How many opportunities did I lose because of those clumsy, robotic sentences? 
The anxiety, however, is still there, a ghost of a feeling. Is this too good? Will they know it wasn't me? The shame whispers, You are cheating. But then I look at the clock. I have ten minutes left of my break. The app took  seconds. The time saved is a physical, tangible 
gift. I copy the text, paste it into my email, and hit send. It is terrifying, but for the first time, I am sending a piece of myself out into the professional world that is not crippled by my English. It feels like taking a deep, clean breath after living underwater. 
Entry : After Using The Product 
(After Receiving a High Grade on the Essay and a Positive Work Response) Date: November st Time: : PM 
I just got the email. My Aseptic Technique essay—the one I wrote with the help of the app— came back with an A-. The professor’s note was simple: “Excellent structure and clear articulation of complex procedures. Well done.” 
I am sitting here, not exhausted, but vibrating with a quiet, deep-seated confidence. The stone of shame that has lived in my stomach for years has finally cracked. It is not gone, but it is crumbling. 
The relief is immense, like a fever breaking. I did not fail. I did not embarrass myself. I was understood. My knowledge was recognized. I look at my children sleeping, and the anxiety
about their future is quieter tonight. The wall didn't disappear, but the app gave me a key— a powerful, professional key. 
The true victory is not the grade, but the time. I finished my homework two hours earlier tonight. Two hours! I spent that time reading a book to my daughter, not fighting with Google Translate. I was fully present. I was a mother, not just a stressed-out student and worker. 
I realize now that the problem was never my intelligence. The problem was the translation gap between my brain and the English-speaking world. The app didn't teach me English; it simply removed the barrier that was hiding my competence. 
I feel a surge of pride. This is not a magic trick; it is a tool that finally honors my effort. I am still Sofia, the woman who works the hard shifts and studies late. But now, when I speak, the world hears the RN I am about to become. I am no longer fighting the language; I am using it. Gracias a Dios. The fight is not over, but the weapon I have now is formidable. I can breathe. I can finally see the finish line.
