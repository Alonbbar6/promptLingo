# Python pkgutil AttributeError - FIXED ‚úÖ

## The Problem

Netlify was detecting `requirements.txt` in the root directory and automatically attempting to install Python dependencies, causing this error:

```
AttributeError: module 'pkgutil' has no attribute 'ImpImporter'. Did you mean: 'zipimporter'?
```

This happened because:
1. Netlify auto-detects `requirements.txt` and tries to set up a Python environment
2. There was a version mismatch between Python packages and the Python interpreter
3. Your app is actually a React/Node.js app and doesn't need Python for deployment

## The Solution

**Moved Python files out of the root directory** to prevent Netlify from detecting them:

```
requirements.txt ‚Üí python-dev/requirements.txt
streamlit_app.py ‚Üí python-dev/streamlit_app.py
```

## What Changed

### Files Modified:
1. **`netlify.toml`** - Added environment variables to skip Python:
   - `PYTHON_VERSION = ""`
   - `SKIP_PYTHON_INSTALL = "true"`

2. **`.netlify-ignore`** - Explicitly ignores `python-dev/` directory

3. **`.gitignore`** - Updated with comments about Python files

4. **Python files moved** - All Python-related files are now in `python-dev/`

### Files Created:
- `python-dev/README.md` - Documentation for Python development files

## Verification

After pushing these changes, Netlify will:
- ‚úÖ Only detect Node.js (via `package.json`)
- ‚úÖ Use Node.js 18.17.0 (specified in `.nvmrc`)
- ‚úÖ Skip Python dependency installation completely
- ‚úÖ Build only the React app from `client/` directory

## Next Steps

1. **Trigger a new deploy** in Netlify (it should auto-deploy from the git push)
2. **Monitor the build logs** - You should see:
   - No Python installation attempts
   - Only Node.js and npm installation
   - Successful React build

3. **If build still fails**, check:
   - Netlify is using the correct branch (`main`)
   - Build settings match `netlify.toml`
   - No cached Python environment (clear cache in Netlify settings)

## How to Use Python Files Locally

If you need to run the Streamlit app for testing:

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r python-dev/requirements.txt

# Run Streamlit app
streamlit run python-dev/streamlit_app.py
```

## Build Configuration Summary

```yaml
Framework: React (Create React App)
Node Version: 18.17.0
Build Command: cd client && npm install && npm run build
Publish Directory: client/build
Python: DISABLED ‚ùå
```

**Status:** Ready to deploy! üöÄ

The Python version mismatch error should now be completely resolved.
