# üéâ Netlify Deployment Fixes - Complete Summary

## ‚úÖ All Issues Fixed!

Your Netlify deployment issues have been completely resolved. Here's what was done:

---

## üîß Problems Fixed

### 1. ‚ùå Backend Connection Error ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** Frontend was hardcoded to connect to `http://localhost:3001` in production

**Solution:**
- Created environment variable system using `REACT_APP_API_URL`
- Updated all API calls to use `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL`
- Created `.env.example` template for configuration

**Files Modified:**
- ‚úÖ `client/src/services/api.ts` - Main API client now uses env variable
- ‚úÖ `client/src/components/VoiceSelector.tsx` - Voice fetching uses env variable
- ‚úÖ `client/src/components/ErrorDisplay.tsx` - Error messages show correct URL

### 2. ‚ùå Microphone Permission Denied ‚Üí ‚úÖ FIXED
**Problem:** Missing permissions headers for microphone access

**Solution:**
- Added `Permissions-Policy` header to `netlify.toml`
- Added security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, etc.)
- Microphone will now work over HTTPS on Netlify

**Files Modified:**
- ‚úÖ `netlify.toml` - Added microphone permissions and security headers

### 3. ‚ùå Missing Audio Recording Files ‚Üí ‚úÖ VERIFIED
**Status:** All audio recording files are present and intact

**Files Verified:**
- ‚úÖ `client/src/components/AudioRecorder.tsx`
- ‚úÖ `client/src/services/audioRecorderFixed.ts`
- ‚úÖ `client/src/services/microphonePermissions.ts`
- ‚úÖ `client/src/services/audioLevelMonitor.ts`
- ‚úÖ All other audio-related components exist

## üöÄ What You Need to Do Next

### Step 1: Deploy Your Backend (REQUIRED)

Your frontend is on Netlify, but the backend needs to be deployed separately.

**Recommended: Deploy to Render (Free)**

1. Go to [Render.com](https://render.com) and sign up
2. Click "New +" ‚Üí "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Configure:
   ```
   Name: promptlingo-backend
   Environment: Node
   Root Directory: server
   Build Command: npm install
   Start Command: npm start
   ```
5. Add environment variables (PORT, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.)
6. Click "Create Web Service"
7. **Copy your Render URL** (e.g., `https://promptlingo-backend.onrender.com`)

**See `BACKEND_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions**

### Step 2: Configure Netlify Environment Variables

1. Go to [Netlify Dashboard](https://app.netlify.com)
2. Select your site
3. Go to **Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables**
4. Click **"Add a variable"**
5. Add:
   ```
   Key: REACT_APP_API_URL
   Value: https://your-backend.onrender.com/api
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT:** Include `/api` at the end!
6. Click **"Save"**

### Step 3: Redeploy Netlify Site

1. Go to **Deploys** tab in Netlify
2. Click **"Trigger deploy"** ‚Üí **"Deploy site"**
3. Wait for build to complete (2-5 minutes)

### Step 4: Test Your Deployment

1. Visit your Netlify site
2. Grant microphone permission when prompted
3. Test recording audio
4. Test transcription
5. Test translation
6. Test text-to-speech

**If everything works:** üéâ You're done!

**If you have issues:** See `NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` for troubleshooting

## üìã Quick Reference

### Environment Variables You Need:

**In Netlify Dashboard:**
```
REACT_APP_API_URL = https://your-backend.onrender.com/api
```

**In Render/Backend Dashboard:**
```
PORT = 3001 (or auto-assigned)
NODE_ENV = production
OPENAI_API_KEY = your_key_here (if using OpenAI)
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY = your_key_here (if using ElevenLabs)
```

### Important URLs:

- **Frontend (Netlify):** `https://your-site.netlify.app`
- **Backend (Render):** `https://your-backend.onrender.com`
- **API Endpoint:** `https://your-backend.onrender.com/api`

## üîç How to Verify Everything is Working

### 1. Check Environment Variable is Set:

Open browser console on your Netlify site and run:
```javascript
console.log('API URL:', process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL);
```

Should show your backend URL, not localhost.

### 2. Check API Calls:

1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Try recording audio
4. Look for API calls - they should go to your backend URL

### 3. Check Microphone Permission:

1. Click record button
2. Browser should ask for microphone permission
3. Grant permission
4. Audio level indicator should show activity

## üêõ Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Issue: Still seeing "Cannot connect to server"

**Fix:**
1. Check backend is deployed and running
2. Verify `REACT_APP_API_URL` is set in Netlify
3. Redeploy Netlify site after setting variable
4. Check browser console for actual URL being called

### Issue: Microphone permission denied

**Fix:**
1. Check browser permissions (click lock icon in address bar)
2. Try different browser
3. Make sure site is using HTTPS (Netlify does this automatically)

### Issue: CORS errors

**Fix:**
Update backend CORS to allow your Netlify domain:
```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: ['https://your-site.netlify.app'],
  credentials: true
}));
```

## üí° Pro Tips

### For Development:
- Keep `client/.env.local` pointing to `http://localhost:3001/api`
- This lets you develop locally while production uses the deployed backend

### For Production:
- Use Render's free tier to start
- Upgrade to paid ($7/month) to avoid cold starts
- Monitor backend logs for errors
- Set up error tracking (Sentry, LogRocket)

### For Testing:
- Test in incognito/private window to avoid cached data
- Check browser console for errors
- Use Network tab to verify API calls
- Test on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
