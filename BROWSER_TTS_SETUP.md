   - Falls back to browser voices automatically
   - Clear labeling of voice source

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### Step 1: Check API Status

Open in browser: `http://localhost:3001/api/health`

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-18T13:00:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 123.456,
  "apis": {
    "openai": "configured",
    "elevenlabs": "not configured",  // or "working (29 voices available)"
    "elevenLabsVoicesCount": 0       // or actual count
  },
  "browserTTSAvailable": true
}
```

### Step 2: Test Translation with Audio

1. **Start the app**:
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd server
   npm start
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

2. **Record and translate**:
   - Record audio: "Hello, how are you?"
   - Translation completes
   - **Audio should play automatically!**

3. **Check what you see**:

   **With Browser TTS (No ElevenLabs):**
   ```
   ✅ Voice Selection (Browser TTS - Free)
   ℹ️ Using free browser voices
      Add an ElevenLabs API key for higher quality AI voices
   
   [Voice dropdown shows browser voices]
   
   ✅ Audio played using free browser text-to-speech
   ```

   **With ElevenLabs (API key configured):**
   ```
   ✅ Voice Selection (ElevenLabs AI)
   
   [Voice dropdown shows AI voices]
   
   Audio generated in 2.45s
   ```

### Step 3: Check Console Logs

**Browser Console (F12):**

```
🎯 useEffect triggered: New audio blob detected
🆕 New audio blob detected, processing...
🚀 [FRONTEND] Starting translation request #1...
📤 [CALL #1] Transcription request starting

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No voices available"

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify browser supports Web Speech API
3. Try different browser (Chrome, Edge work best)

**Test browser support:**
```javascript
// Open browser console and run:
console.log('speechSynthesis' in window); // Should be true
console.log(window.speechSynthesis.getVoices()); // Should show voices
```

### Issue: Audio doesn't play

**Solution 1: Check auto-play settings**
- Some browsers block auto-play
- Click the play button manually
- Enable auto-play in browser settings

**Solution 2: Check audio permissions**
- Ensure browser has permission to play audio
- Check browser settings → Site permissions

**Solution 3: Check console for errors**
- Open browser console (F12)
- Look for audio playback errors
- Check if audio URL is valid

### Issue: ElevenLabs not working

**Check API key:**
```bash
# In server/.env
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=sk-...  # Should start with your key
```

**Test API key:**
```bash
curl -H "xi-api-key: YOUR_KEY_HERE" https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/voices
```

**Expected:** JSON with list of voices

**If error:** API key is invalid or expired

### Issue: Browser TTS voice quality is poor

**Solutions:**
1. **Add ElevenLabs API key** for better quality
2. **Try different browser voices** in the dropdown
3. **Use Chrome or Edge** (better voice quality)
4. **Adjust playback speed** in audio settings
